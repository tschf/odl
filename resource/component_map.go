// ComponentPackageMap is an alias to a map[string]string. It is used to store
// component names to relate to which package they belong to. For example
// the instantclient package consists of: instantclient-sqlplus, instantclient-basic
// etc. So I want a reference to know which component belongs to which package
// to aid in determining which package to pull from
